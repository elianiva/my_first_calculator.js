# My First Calculator
> this repo is just a joke of course.

I saw a joke about someone made a calculator using if statements in Python and
I don't think they made it manually, there got to be a generator for it.
Actually, there is! I look the original repo which is over [here](https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py) and found a `generator.py` on
their repo and because I'm bored enough, I decided to make a Javascript
version. It's probably not the best since I'm still a newb, but it is what it is.

## Generate
To generate the file, just run
```bash
node generator.js
```

## Run
To run the file, just do
```bash
node my_first_calculator.js
```

You can adjust the limit by changing the `limit` variable on `generator.js` file
